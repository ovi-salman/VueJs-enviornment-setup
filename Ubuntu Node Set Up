Installing Node.js and npm from NodeSource

NodeSource is a company focused on providing enterprise-grade Node support and they maintain a repository containing the latest versions of Node.js.

Use this repository if you need to install a specific version of Node.js. At the time of writing, NodeSource repository provides the following versions - v12.x, v11.x, v10.x, and v8.x. Weâ€™ll install the current LTS version of Node.js, version 10.x, Carbon.

To install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository, follow these steps:

    Enable the NodeSource repository by running the following curl as a user with sudo privileges:

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -

    The command will add the NodeSource signing key to your system, create an apt sources repository file, install all necessary packages and refresh the apt cache.

    If you need to install another version, for example 12.x, just change setup_10.x with setup_12.x

    Once the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm by typing:

    sudo apt install nodejs

    The nodejs package contains both the node and npm binaries.

    Verify that the Node.js and npm were successfully installed by printing their versions:

    node --version

    v10.16.3

    npm --version

    6.9.0
